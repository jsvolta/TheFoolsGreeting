## Features
A single page application that takes your DnD character's basic information and generates a greeting from a fool.

## Running this project locally
From the repo:
1. Clone this project locally
2. Open the index.html file in a browser

## Dev Dependencies
There is nothing this project is dependent on. However, I use a lot of TODO, NOTE, or FIXME comments throughout. I would recommend that you use a todo highlighter like [folke's todo-comments for neovim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim).
